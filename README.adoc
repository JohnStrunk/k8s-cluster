= A kubeadm-based Kubernetes cluster in Vagrant

== Prerequisites
The vagrant-sshfs plugin must be installed via:
```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-sshfs
```
Also ensure the disk size and memory of the VMs specified in `Vagrantfile` is appropriate for your system

== Basic usage
To bring up a basic multi-node cluster, just run:

[source, bash]
----
$ vagrant up
----

To customize the number of nodes, edit `WORKERS` at the top of the
`Vagrantfile`.

== Upgrading the version of Kubernetes

By default, the cluster is built with the most recent version supported by
`kubeadm`. For development, you can upgrade the version on the nodes using the
included Ansible playbook. Make sure you update the `k8s_files` variable first
to point to your source directory.

Since the Vagrant environment requires special inventory files and ssh
parameters, instead of directly invoking `ansible-playbook`, use the included
`acmd` script:

[source, bash]
----
$ ./acmd ansible/upgrade_k8s_source.yml
----
